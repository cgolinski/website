## Welcome! 
The High Fives Foundation supports the dreams of mountain action sports athletes by raising injury prevention awareness while providing resources and inspiration to those who suffer life altering injuries. This project aims to offer High Fives technical expertise via web development, database design, and mobile app development support. We are building
