##Suggesting Features
Most of the features in the High Fives Project were suggested by the community at some point in time. We welcome any ideas about how to make our project better for your use case, centered around a11y best practices. Unless there is overwhelming demand for a feature, it might not get implemented immediately, but please include as much information as possible that will help people have a discussion about your proposal:
1. **Use case:** What are you trying to accomplish, in specific terms? Often, there might already be a good way to do what you need and a new feature is unnecessary, but it’s hard to know without information about the specific use case.
2. **Could this be a plugin?** In many cases, a feature might be too niche to be included in the core of a library, and is better implemented as a companion package. If there isn’t a way to extend the library to do what you want, could we add additional plugin APIs? It’s important to make the case for why a feature should be part of the core functionality of the library.
3. **Is there a workaround?** Is this a more convenient way to do something that is already possible, or is there some blocker that makes a workaround unfeasible?
Feature requests will be labeled as such, and we encourage using GitHub issues as a place to discuss new features and possible implementation designs. 

Please refrain from submitting a pull request to implement a proposed feature until there is consensus that it should be included. This way, you can avoid putting in work that can’t be merged in.

##Responding to Issues
In addition to reporting issues, a great way to contribute to our Project is to respond to other peoples’ issues and try to identify the problem or help them work around it. If you’re interested in taking a more active role in this process, please let us know on the [High Fives Engineering Slack.](https://join.slack.com/t/highfivesengineering/shared_invite/enQtNDE2ODUxNjMwNjEzLTM1NjA4Mjc3NDYxOGNkM2UwMmVhYmQ4MWFhMWI0ZTc1MGY4NWQzYjAxNWE1NDAyNGNlMTRlMTA4ZmY0NTYzYzY)

##Documentation Fixes
Improving the documentation, examples, and other open source content can be the easiest way to contribute to the library. If you see a piece of content that can be better, open a PR with an improvement, no matter how small! If you would like to suggest a big change or major rewrite, we’d love to hear your ideas, but please open an issue for discussion before writing the PR.
